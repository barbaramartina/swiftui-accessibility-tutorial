## Spoken Content
When using the capabilities of the spoken content feature, your users will be able to read the screen or the selected text. To avoid verbosity, you could make use of a modifier which allows you to hide some views from the accessibility features. For example when some of your table cells are too populated with information, you might want to hide some images or text which would add much verbosity to the spoken content feature.
