## Motion
There is an option in Settings > Accessibility > Reduce Motion, that users can choose when animations could trigger undesired effects for them. According to Apple’s documentation “Vestibular disorders are caused by problems affecting the inner ear and parts of the brain that control balance and spatial orientation. Symptoms can include loss of balance, nausea, and other physical discomfort. Vestibular disorders are more common than you might guess: affecting as many as 69 million people in the United States alone.”
You can react to the user preference by reading the environment variable accessibilityReduceMotion, and reacting either removing animations or making them slower /. More appropriate.
