# Usage
Making an analysis of some studies or surveys, you could give yourself an idea about what accessibility features are the most needed / used. I have found some resources which could be a guide for deciding the priorities when it comes to adopting certain features. For example in this survey of millions of users in the Netherlands, in 2024, it was found that 38% of persons turn on dark mode, while 22% make their fonts larger, 9,7% use zoom on the screen, 9,8% have turned on bold text, 3,6% use speak selection, 0,02% use VoiceOver. https://appt.org/en/stats.

But, I would not recommend just reading current usage statistics, since it could be that people do not make use of certain features just because the support offered right now is not great. 

Another idea to collect numbers, is to try finding scientific studies, which are usually constricted to certain application domains, but you could perhaps find some closer to your user base, such as for example https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095058492400123X.
In this sense, which accessibility support you would prioritize will be very related to the field in which your app is working.
