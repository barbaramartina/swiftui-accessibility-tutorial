# Display Text and Sizes
By going to Settings -> Display and Brightness -> Text Size the users will be able to select a preference for the size of text they would like to see.
You can adjust your texts automatically  by using the “font(…” modifier in SwiftUI, watch for your views truncation mode, make sure that the text is not truncated, or that is the text is very long, it can occupy at least a minimum amount of lines which can help the user to understand the associated content on the screen.
Additionally by accessing the dynamic type size you can make adjustments in your layout to accommodate different sizes preferences
Go to my previous article, mentioned before, to see the source code.
