https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202&intPageId=5581&langId=en

## Micro Enterprises and SMEs
Be aware that each country should have their own local legal translation of the Act. 
And that the act makes some differentiation in regards how it needs to be translated into concrete regulations for microenterprises and SMEs (“‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ or ‘SMEs’ means enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million, but excludes microenterprises;”)

## Content produced before June 28, 2025
To avoid overwork while preparing for adopting the Act, be aware that there are some boundaries drawn by the initial directive defined in 2019 (article 2, point 4, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882):

- “This Directive does not apply to the following content of websites and mobile applications:
    a) pre-recorded time-based media published before 28 June 2025;
    b) office file formats published before 28 June 2025;
    c) online maps and mapping services, if essential information is provided in an accessible digital manner for maps intended for navigational use;
    d) third-party content that is neither funded, developed by, or under the control of, the economic operator concerned;
    e) content of websites and mobile applications qualifying as archives, meaning that they only contain content that is not updated or edited after 28 June 2025.“


What all mobile app and websites should comply to is defined by the directive in Annex I, this is a minimum of requirements, and some type of services need to comply to a wider scope.
